Blaeus is a C# library for the management of data of geographic localities, mostly populated places. The name of the library is inspired by the Dutch cartographers, Willem and Joan Blaeus. 
The library includes the domain geospatial classes, tolls for their storage on an SQlite database, and three popular online gazetteers: Geonames, Openstreetmap, and Wikidata.
